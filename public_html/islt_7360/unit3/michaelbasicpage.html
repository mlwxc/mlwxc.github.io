<p>This webpage will be the starting point of my project. I am creating an index of books of all types. This will include genres and subgenres. <br>There will be an author biography and links to their websites. I also wish to include a search bar for the author, genre, and title. I want to make this a smart search, kind of like Google, but limited to just this website.</p>
