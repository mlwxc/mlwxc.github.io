<h1 style="text-align:center;border:thin solid #000000;background-color:#cc3300;color:#ffffff">Michael Lewis' Basic Webpage</h1>

<p>This webpage is to express the ideas of the type of webpages I would like to make. On this page, I will list two different ideas for websites along with the items I would like to include.</p>

<h2 style="border:thin solid #000000;text-align:center;background-color:darkred;color:white">First Idea</h2>

<p>This webpage will be the starting point of my project. I am creating an index of books of all types. I want to make this a smart search, kind of like Google, but limited to just this website. I don't want to people to feel they have to leave this
website in order to find what they are looking for. I would also like to make a favorite books log in. That way if they find something they would enjoy reading they would be able to instantly go back to the book
and have all the relevant information they need. However, I do not want to make suggestions to the reader, because I feel this would limit their choices.</p>
<h3>Items to Include</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Author</li>
    <li>Genre</li>
    <li>Popularity</li>
    <li>ISBN</li>
    <li>Reviews</li>
    <li>Smart search limited to the website.</li>
    <li>Ability to create a favorite list exclusive to a person.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>There is one website that is similar to what I would like to make and that is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">goodreads.com</a>. They allow people to create an account to favorite books and allow the site
to make recommendations. People are able to comment and rate the books they have read. It also contains information on the authors and the list of books they have written. This is one the closest example of a website
that I would like to make, but this one makes suggestions along with the rating system. I think this would cloud people's own judgements.</blockquote>


<h2 style="border:thin solid #000000;text-align:center;background-color:darkred;color:white">Second Idea</h2>
<p>My second idea would be about helping new dungeon masters (DMs) in Dungeons and Dragons. I would create a place for them to find helpful items and a place to find lists of rules. I donâ€™t want to break any
 copyright laws so this one would be a little tricky. I would have to create links to other websites and only include information that people would be able to find easily. I could also link to videos on Youtube that
  would inform people of certain situations they might encounter and how to adapt to situations. The website would be a directory.</p>
<h3>Items to Include</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Link to Dungeons and Dragons website.</li>
    <li>Information about player decisions and adaptation.</li>
    <li>Links to Youtubers that have this type of content.</li>
    <li>Commonly occuring problems.</li>
    <li>Create scenarios that would allow the DM to think abstractly.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>There are many websites on the internet for basic rules and helping players out. However, the only place that I have seen to help DMS is on Youtube. These are only videos and offer a limited form of support.
This website would create a place for DMs to look at scenarios they might encounter and maybe even upload some of their own for people to view. They wouldn't have to go through a subreddit to find the correct account.
