<h2><b>Mission statement</b></h2>

<br>
            
<p>The mission of this website is to create a website for people to find any book in any type of genre that they want. This is a website where the student can go to find a book on children's psychology and a person 
    can find a science-fiction novel. Each book section will have a summary of the novel, the writer of the novel, and a link to a place to buy the item from. If there is no author website, a brief biography will 
    be added for the user.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<br>
<p>The eventual goal of this website is to list every genre of book in the world, fiction and nonfiction. Hopefully, this will include every language as well.
     There will also be a section for new authors on this main page. This website will eventually become a world repository for books. New things will be added as they appear and older items will be introduced. 
    Everything will be included.</p>
