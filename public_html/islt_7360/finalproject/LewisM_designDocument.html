<h2>Purpose</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Goals</dt>
    <dd>This website will offer a place for people to find any novel, series, or author they are looking
        for. This also gives users a place to browse without being limited to what their library has.</dd>
    
    <dt>User Needs</dt>
    <dd>Users would be of all ages. Able to search for a specific subgenre in a genre, such as 
        dystopia novels in a fantasy novel. Users can find information on authors and the novels
        they have written. Users would be able to use a search bar for the information they want 
        as well.</dd>
    
    <dt>Benefits of the Website</dt>
    <dd>This would become a one-stop "shop" for people to find a book. There wouldn't be the limitation
        of a library catalog. Users would be able to come here and find a book related to a series or
        novel that isn't in their library</dd>
    
</dl>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<ol>
    <li>A student is looking for a recent book on the psychology of children and A.D.D. The subgenres
        would allow the user to find a book on children's psychology and under this heading they could
        find a book on A.D.D.</li>
    <li>The user is looking for information on a specific author. Theyare able to use the search
        function to find the author they are searching. The author's preferred genre of writing and the age
        group they write for. The page would also contain a link to the author's website, if they have one.</li>
    <li>A user is looking for information about a specific book. They are able to find the book 
        and find novels related on the topics discussed. The book page would also contain the genres it is listed as
        and would link to the different pages conatining the books pertaining to that subject.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Design Concept</h2>
<ol style="font-weight: bold">
    <li>Audience
    
        <ul><li>Ages: I want to make this website accessible to all ages.</li>
    <li>Gender: Gender is not applicable here.</li>
    <li>Location: This will probably be used in the United States and other English-speaking countries. I will not be able to get this set up for all languages.</li>
    <li>Living and Hobbies>: I want this to be available for all employments and hobbies. If somebody wants to find more information on birds, they can find books on the study of birds. If a physics professor wants more
        information on a subject, they can find it under the heading for physics and the particular portion they are curious about.</li>
    <li>Computer skills: This website will be easy to navigate. The user should be able to find all of the information from the top and navigate from there if they wish.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Reference Websites
    
    <ul><li>This <a href="https://www.fantasticfiction.com/">website</a> is the original inspiration for my website. However, I think the navigation is clunky and the website looks extremely busy.</li>
        <li>The next reference would be <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/28010.Chris_Crutcher">here</a>. This website has a lot of good ideas, but I really like the author page. There
        is a list of quotes from him, the author's website, and the type of literature he writes.</li>
        <li>Library catalogs are an excellent source for a search function. My local library, <a href="https://dbrl.bibliocommons.com/">Daniel Boone Regional Library</a>, uses bibliocommons to make their card catalog. 
        The search function they use is quite amazing and this is the type of search I would like to use in my own website.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Category:Bookshelf">Project Gutenberg</a> is a website made for novels out of copyright laws. The feature, bookshelves, is very well designed. It is separated
        by letter and everything is evenly spaced. This is the type of subgenre list I would like to make.</li>
        <li>The last website is <a href="http://www.openingthebook.com/whichbook/">whichbook</a>. This website has a slider on their homepage that allows the user to indicate what they would like more of 
        in their book. That is impressive and I doubt I will be able to accomplish anything like this, it is something to aspire towards.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ol>

<h2>Presentation Information</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Content Synopsis: I want each portion to be separate. I want a thick border around the body of the website with information broken up by tables. I want the home button to be large on the very top
    and would prefer for it to move with the navigation through the page. If a person scrolls down the webpage I want it to follow them. This way they don't have to constantly return to the top of the website
    to navigate around.</li>
    <li>Text Outline: The home page has the home button/name of the website on the very top in a dashed box. Underneath will be the navigation buttons for fiction and nonfiction. Those will link to different
    pages containing a list of genres. Those genres would also have links to further classifications, in order, to help the user find what they need. Those classifications will be alphabetized for easy finding. 
    The search bar would also be contained on the top of the webpage.</li>
    <li>Wireframe: <a href="http://mlwxc.github.io/public_html/islt_7360/finalproject/homepagedesign.docx">Home Page Design</a>.</li>
    <li>Rationale: Everything is clearly labeled and easy for the user to find. The navigation will be hyperlinked and separated to allow for no misclicks to happen. I am unsure of whether to put the search bar
    above or below the subject labels. This will be on the top for users to immediately find and use.</li>
    <li>Media: I want to put a picture of a bookcase filled with stories. Something to show the endlessness of the website. I plan to find these images on a free use website, and I will put the copyright
    information to the right below the picture. I also want to put images of the cover page of the book and a picture of the author on their page. Everything that is copyright will be included on the webpage.</li>
    <li>Color Scheme: The pages will have a background color of parchment with the type on the webpage being black.</li>
    </ol>
