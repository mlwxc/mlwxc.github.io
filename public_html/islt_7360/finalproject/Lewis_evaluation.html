<h1>Evaluation of Michael's Book Exploration</h1>
<h2>Evaluators</h2>
<p><b>First Evaluator</b>: Haley<br>
    She is a friend that knows a bit about design coding. Haley works with art quite a bit and 
    I contacted her in order to get her opinion about the design aspects of the website.
     She also used her phone to test the usefulness of the website on a mobile system. 
     She used an iPhone 7 with safari. The operating system it used was iOS 11.
    </p>
    <br>
<p><b>Second Evaluator</b>: Holden<br>
    Holden is a person who spends quite a bit of time on the internet web surfing. 
    He is someone I go to when I need to find out how to do something technologically related 
    that is out of my depth. He is knowledgeable in coding, web functions, and ways to make 
    things easier for people to access. There isn’t anything computer related he doesn’t know 
    how to do, at least a little bit. He uses a Windows 10 OS and his browser is the latest 
    version of Google Chrome.
    </p>
    <br>
<p><b>Third Evaluator</b>: Justin<br>
    Justin is a friend of Holden’s. I wanted somebody I didn’t know in any way to look at the website and see if they liked the design of it. 
    He told me he has no ability to code. I wanted someone that would signify an average end-user. 
    Somebody that has no knowledge of the person that created the website and held no bias towards the person.
     He told me he was using a Windows 10 OS and the latest version of Mozilla Firefox.

<h2>Summary of Evaluator's Comments</h2>

<caption>Evaluator's Comments</caption>
<tr>
    <td><b>Design</b></td>
    <td><b>Comments</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Logical Supporting Pages and table of comments</td>
    <td>One of my evaluators admitted to knowing how to find items with a control-f function and therefore, did not need a table of contents.
        However, the rest of users did not know this function and this was something I planned to add to the website. Therefore, this just made it very clear the end-user will need a table of contents
        to navigate the site more efficiently
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Site displays sound design principles</td>
    <td>Nobody felt one way or the other about this particular design. I asked for more detail, but they just felt this piece was not worthy to comment on. I felt this to mean the people didn't see the website 
        as standing out enough to comment on this particular item. <!-- I hope to improve this further, because I did my best to get feedback for this portion -->
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Navigation is intutive and easy to understand</td>
    <td>Two of my evaluators thought this was quite easy to understand, but they all felt it needed a return to top feature, or a fixed navigation bar. The last evaluator thought this would make the whole 
        navigation easier to understand, referring to a moving navigation bar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Homepage is linked from all subsequent pages.</td>
    <td>All of my evaluators told me the home button needs to be added to the navigation bar. I thought if I linked the top home heading to the home page it might be cleaner, but it appears the home button 
        on the naivgation bar is needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Multimedia Elements <!-- I am going to encompass all of theses --></td>
    <td>This is not applicable to my page at the moment. I have no multimedia elements to my page though I hope to add some images shortly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Text is easy to read and contrasts with background.</td>
    <td>Nobody had a hard time read everything. They said everything contrasted nicely and the background color and text color was easily readable. One of my evaluators did mention the pages did not look welcoming. 
        I wanted to make the pages look like older parchment with ink writing, but the digital colors did not come off in this way. They told me I might want to consider making the pages a light blue to make the website 
        more welcoming.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Site content is widely accessible.</td>
    <td>This was harder for my evaluators to answer. I don't have much content available on my website yet. I think I am trying to include too much into the website, and therefore, there is nothing 
        for them to comment on towards the comment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>Content</b></td>
    <td><b>Comments</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Pages have clear and appropriate tile in title bar.</td>
    <td>All evaluator's agreed this portion was clear. Thought I might need to add a banner to the heading title though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Links are appropriate, clearly labeled, and have a definite purpose.</td>
    <td>The only links I have are to the other pages and both were easily checked and made sure they worked. I was curious about the switch between pages needing to be clearer. I might want to add 
        some sort of graphic to make that clearer, but no one really said anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Information is accurate and current.</td>
    <td>One evaluator did comment that it was updated on a different day and said that I need to make constant updates to the information. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Site stimulates thinking and reflection or serves a useful purpose for an identified audience.</td>
    <td>The evaluators thought this was clearly expressed in the goal. However, they did worry that there was too much to encompass for me alone and worried that I wouldn't be able to give it all my full attention.
        <!-- Admittedly, I am thinking more and more the same. I really should have thought this through while making the site -->
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>Credibility</b></td>
    <td><b>Comments</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Credibility is established by including information regarding author, affiliations, and credentials.</td>
    <td>This portion is not applicable for website at this moment. I still have to add this information into the webpage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Contact information is included</td>
    <td>This was easily locatable to everyone on the home page. They told me to consider making a contact page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Site is bias-free or explicitly states point of view</td>
    <td>The evaluators all agreed that the website does not have a view point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Material is original or includes appropriate citations with no copyright infringement.</td>
    <td>Nobody mentioned seeing any copyright infringements. I showed them the other sites closely related to the one I am trying to make, but they did not mention it looking like an infringement. 
        This was my big worry and apparently no one noticed anything to similar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Correct grammar, punctuation, and spelling.</td>
    <td>None of my evaluators noticed anything incorrect in the grammar or spelling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Site indicateds date that material was created or updated.</td>
    <td>One evaluator did mention this and how I had not updated it in a couple days.</td>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<p>My website has not met my use case scenarios. I don't have enough information for the use cases. I wanted to include author information, but that is not in there yet. Neither is there any book information yet. 
    The purpose of the site was to create a place for everyone to go and find a book they wanted to read. But I don't have any information available for them yet. I don't have links to resources for them to look at 
    books or authors. Neither do I have every genre available for exploration. I might have to abandon some items I wanted to get to, because the website would be impossible for one person to build by themselves, in the 
    time I have.
</p>
<h2>Recommended Changes</h2>
<p>I need to get the table of contents set up for ease of navigation. I also need to get graphics set into the webpage correctly. I might want to think about limiting myself to maybe one genre in fiction or nonfiction. 
    This would give users a clear idea of what I would like to make. Focus on that genre and create a list of books in that area with authors for the books. I am hoping this will improve the usability of the website. 
    It would also make the website more approachable and less daunting for the end-user. 
</p>
<h2>Reflections on Evaluations</h2>
<p>Doing these evaluations were necessary for me. I would have never realized how much was wrong with my website without people to point out the problems. I knew I needed to add a table of contents, but the 
    background color was not something I would have thought would detract from the site. They showed me I need to be focused on more than just the content of the website, but the design as well. I, also, noticed 
    how hard it is for people to find users to evaluate their websites. I spent most of my week attempting to find people to evaluate my work. This might be some of the reasons certain projects never get off of the ground.<br>
<br>Every person was incredibly helpful in pointing out the flaws. I needed more than one person's perspective. This is the problem I had in one of my previous assignments. I wasn't able to find multiple people to evaluate.
 I was able to find three people to give me some helpful use cases, but nothing more than that. I was really excited to find someone I didn't know to evaulate my site. They told me everything that was wrong with no 
 reason to spare my feelings. Justin was the most useful person to help me with this assignment.
